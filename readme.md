# Generic OS setup

Files are grouped by major Operating System type, so I have got

- [debian](./debian) for Debian-based systems
- [macos](./macos) for MacOS
- [nix](./nix) for NixOS
- [windows](./windows) for Windows systems
- [common](./common) for OS-independent files

Private keys etc. are placed in `common/secrets/` on each OS where this repository is cloned to, and of course ignored in `.gitignore`.

Use at your own risk.
