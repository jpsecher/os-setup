# Generic OS setup

Use at your own risk.

Files are grouped by major Operating System type:

- [debian](./debian) for Debian-based systems
- [macos](./macos) for MacOS
- [nixos](./nixos) for NixOS
- [windows](./windows) for Windows
- [common](./common) for OS-independent files

Private keys etc. are placed in `common/secrets/` on each OS where this repository is cloned to, and of course ignored in `.gitignore`.
